# Inspiration
We noticed how the pandemic has negatively impacted the way people manage their time. Thus causing more people to fall victim to procrastination. Therefore, Time Wise aims to help get these people back on track and converting them into more productive individuals.

# What it does
Time Wise is a chrome extension that can be used to organize tasks in order of priority to make the most out of your precious time. The user is prompt with an option to manually select a deadline whenever they try to add a new task.

# How we built it
We used react, mainly using JSX(JavaScript XML) to build the functionality of the extension and used styled-components within react to build and design the UI.

# Challenges we ran into
There are many challenges we ran into, and one of them is creating the UI using CSS. Although it wasn't our first time using CSS, it was still quite challenging to style different elements. CSS was also very time-consuming and frustrating when elements did not work out.

Many of our team members were very new to react and HTML and CSS. Many of us spent many hours researching and spending countless time watching youtube tutorials.

Learning how to use a local database wasn't much of a challenge, however, we ran into multiple server issues with how the local database loads and saves data, which made debugging and testing very difficult.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
As high school students, we are proud of how we were able to create a user-friendly and interactive extension in just 2 days. The extension also ended up looking pretty decent and the interaction worked better than expected.

# What we learned
We learned quite a lot about React and how to use styled-components. Along the way, we also learned how to collaborate with each other effectively to make the best use of our skills and strengths.

# What's next for Time Wise
We plan on implementing more features to Time Wise, this way we can ensure the best quality experience for the user and their time. Additionally, we plan on further improving the aesthetic by adding a range of themes the user can choose from and even an option for custom themes.
